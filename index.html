        <h1>Asteroids Plus</h1>
        Welcome to the world's greatest Asteroids game! Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating, but it's a blast! You can
        <a href="./game.html">play it online</a>, too! There's also a
        <a href="https://github.com/Baker531/Asteroids-Plus/releases/tag/alpha-2">Windows version</a> as well. Or view
        the <a href="https://github.com/Baker531/Asteroids-Plus">source code</a> on GitHub. All the ideas for this
        project are <a href="https://github.com/users/Baker531/projects/2">here</a>. <b>v1</b>
