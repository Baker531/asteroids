        <h1>Asteroids Plus</h1>
        Welcome to the world's greatest Asteroids game! Okay, maybe I'm
        exaggerating, but it's a blast! You can
        <a href="./game.html">play it online</a>, too! There's also a <a href="https://github.com/Baker531/Asteroids-Plus/releases/tag/alpha-2">Windows version</a> as well.
        Or view the <a href="https://github.com/Baker531/Asteroids-Plus">source code</a> on GitHub. All the ideas for this project are <a href="https://github.com/users/Baker531/projects/2">here</a>. Version: Alpha 2
