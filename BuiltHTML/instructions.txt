Sometimes, hitting an asteroid gives you a powerup. Hitting an asteroid has a 10% chance and hitting an enemy has a 25% chance to drop a random powerup. Collect it quick! They disappear in 5 seconds. The powerups are:

Two guns: Two forward-facing guns.

Three guns: Three forward-facing guns.

Four guns: Bullets go out from all points of the compass.

Eight guns: Congrats! You just turned into an asteroid-killing machine! Bullets come out in a star formation.

Laser: A powerful (if i can fix it) destroying beam of energy.

Shield: Nothing can get close to you! You have a shield generator! Go headbutt some enemies.

There's lots of enemies in asteroids plus.

Raider: The basic enemy. Can be destroyed in one shot. Fires bullets.

Hunter: Rather keen on dodging. Loves to evade you. Shoots fast bullets.

Brute: Tough. Has 50hp. It doesn't shoot, but instead follows you.

Gunner: The machine-gun enemy. Fires lots of weak bullets. Has 20hp. Wipe it out quick.

Tank: The heaviest. Fires 20-damage bullets infrequently. Avoid. If you ram them, you lose 30hp.

The game is built around asteroids. So they deserve a mention.

When an asteroid is hit, it breaks in two. Unless, of course, it's a small one.

When you smash into an asteroid, you lose:
10 Health for small
15 Health for medium
20 Health for large

When you hit an asteroid, you get 50 points.

you lose a life and restart the level.
